<h1> <center>High School</center></h1>
<p>I turned 17 on the 7th of October 1971. I was still in high school, but I already knew everythingh necessary for success 
in life. At least like most 17 year old kids I thought I did.
I was a Junior in high school (a Sophmore according to my credits), I was working as a produce clerk and part time stocker at the Safeway Grocery store in Temple Texas. I was making decent money and usually got 30 or more hours every week.
 I had recently been suspended from school for fighting. I was ready to get on with my life, which I expected to be full of adventure and glory.</p>
 <p>The problem being that at 17, I had to have my parents sign for me to enlist.  My mother had NO intention of signing the papers for me, obviously I finally convinced her though.</p>
<h1> <center>Recruiting</center></h1>
 <p>I went and spoke with all the recruiters in the Temple, Texas recruiting offices.The Army, Air Force and Navy made all kinds of promises about how great my life would be in their particular branch of the military. 
Consequently I went into the Marine recruiters office with a kind of cocky attitude and said "Here is what the other services offered me,what are you going to promise me " ? Gunnery Sargeant Wheelock was a big Marine with a chest full of medals, He looked me in the eye and said "You will take what we give you and like it" !! </p>
<p>While I have heard many stories of people being lied to by Marine recruiters, I can honestly say that neither my recruiter nor the Marine Corps ever lied to me. Everything they ever promised me I eventually recieved.</p> 
<p>My best friend Anthony VanSickle joined the corps right after I did and we enetered on the buddy system. One of the guys who worked with me (David McCorkle) said he was going to join the corps too, but as far as I know he never did go into the military. Anthony and I went to the Armed Forces Entrance an Examination (AFEES) Station in Dallas, Texas on Tuesday the 9th of May 1972</p>
<p>While at AFEES we were housed at the Adolphus Hotel in Downtown Dallas Texas, an old luxury hotel that had been allowed to run down and was fairly shabby. Anthony and I shared a room with two other guys who were going into the Corps, both of them were former US Army (one of them was Posey and I do not remember the other guys name). While at AFEES we received our physicals, signed lots of paperwork and were sworn in.  We were all supposed to go to San Diego since Texas is west of the Missippi river. At some point someone at the AFEES mentioned that they needed 4 people to finish filling up a platoon at Parris Island, and asked us if we would go there instead. That is how we ended up at PI instead if San Diego.</p>

<h3> <center>Draftees  </center></h3>
<p> Due to being 17 when I enlisted, I never registered for the draft or recieved a draft card. Though many of the people I was in boot camp with were drafted. I do not recall how many people our platoon started with, but I know we lost more than half of them in the first two weeks. Many were sent to what was known as the 'fat farm' to lose weight before actually starting training. Many more though were discharged for attempted suicide, bed wetting etc. Some of the suicide attempts were  really funny, one guy attempted to drown himself by putting his head in a sink full of water. Others were not so funny, one tried to hang himself with his bootlaces ad another cut his wrists with a razor blade</p>
 <p>My Marine Corps boot camp experience was probably pretty average, although there were a few incidents that do stand out. </p>
 <h3> <center>Sick Bay </center></h3>
 <p>Due to an ingrown toenail I ended up in sick bay and spending exactly 1 (one) day on light duty.  I had no idea what to expect, but I positively did NOT expect what happened that day. Suprisingly, I did not have to wait long there were few people in sick bay that morning.  I was seen about 5 minutes after I arrived and was ready to leave about 10 minutes later. The corpsman had me wash my feet and then began working on my toe. It was a quick and simple procedure, he used what appeared to be a pair of chrome wire cutters and cut right down the center of my toenail. He then clamped a pair of hemostats on the side of the toenail that was ingrown and yanked half of it out. Then he put a bandage on my toe and put me on 24 hours of light duty. After that it was back to training for me and it was a very long time before I went to sick bay again.</p>
 <h3> <center>The Smoker </center></h3>
 <p>One of the worst offenses in boot camp was to be caught smoking in the head (bathroom) and it usually happened at night. While we were on the rifle range, one of the guys who was on firewatch decided that he would not get caught and had a quick smoke in the head. Unfortunately for him one of the drill instructors did catch him.</p>
 <p>Before morning chow I am pretty sure we all knew of his transgression. We were very confused because the drill instructors had said nothing to him about the incident. When we went to evening chow he was put at the front of the line. The servers were told to give him double portions of everything. He was required to sit at he table with the drill instructors and made to eat all the food on his plate. Then he was taken back through the chow line and received double portions again and once again made to eat everything on his plate. Shortly after we returned to the barracks we were sent out to smoke, all the smokers except the one who was caught smoking in the head (bathroom) went out to the wash rack to smoke. This was one time I did not go out to smoke, I was curious to see what this guys punishment would be.  </p>
 <p>He was made to stand on his footlocker with his bucket on his head . He then proceeded to smoke about 5 packs of cigarettes(100 cigarettes) one after another, with the drill instructors taking turns calling cadence. They would say 'INHALE' and a few seconds later 'EXHALE'.  The first time he puked he was allowed to take the bucket off his head to use as a receptacle for the puke. I believe he emptied his stomach completely before finishing the first pack. </p>
 <p>After finishing all the cigarettes he had in his footlocker (5 packs) one of the drill instrucctors produced a pack of 4 green cigars and he had to start smoking those. When he passed out I thought it was over, they dragged him into the head and I heard water running in a sink and then water splashing. The next sound I heard was the drill istructor's voice saying 'INHALE', After all these years I am unsure of how long this torture lasted ut it seemed to be a very long time. And I doubt that recruit has ever smoked since that time. I do know that he never again smoked while in boot camp. </p>

<p>The year was 1974, the war in Viet Nam had recently been called off due to lack of interest by the American people.
 I was 20 years old and a Corporal in the United States Marine Corps. And a member of 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company
 at Camp LeJuene North Carolina. The past 19 months I had trained to become a RECON Marine, but due to circumstances
 beyond my control it appeared I would soon be leaving RECON. You cannot imagine how devastated I was. 
 Background information When I joined the Corps I had a guaranteed MOS of aviation supply, a lucrative career field 
 which some of my friends later re-enlisted to get into. I gave that up and requested to go to Camp LeJuene to 
 become a GRUNT and then try out for RECON. Our company Gunny at Supply school came to me the day before graduation 
 and offered me two sets of orders, If I accepted the orders for Yuma Arizona, I would graduate with my class 
 (I was #3 in the class, so would have received a meritorious promotion to Lance corporal) and in his words had an
 easy career in the air wing. I accepted the orders for Camp LeJuene and ended up at Kilo 3/8. After spending time 
 attached to regimental guard and being the company police sergeant for a time, as I had a military driver’s License 
 I was sent to help out in the MotorT section.
Much of my life before the Corps, was spent around automobile junkyards and shade tree mechanics. Our MotorT Chief
 at the time was SSGT Rollison, he was impressed with my work and asked if I would be willing to take the job 
 of being the company dispatcher and shop chief.
I could now stay with the unit I had worked so hard and given up so much to get into. Obviously I accepted and 
stayed there until I left active duty in 1976. I believe it was sometime around the end of 1974, a new 
lance corporal arrived. His MOS was 3521 vehicle mechanic and surprisingly he was extremely squared away. 
He made Sergeant well before I got out in 1976. At that time in the Corps MotorT types usually looked like hell. 
They wore fluff dried utilities and rarely put polish on their boots, and this was the SNCO’s and NCO’s, 
the non-rateds looked even worse. It was rare for MotorT types to ever participate in Physical Training 
or worry about their appearance. The motor T section of 2nd Force Recon was different from the rest, 
just as you would expect us to be. We changed into coveralls and old boots to work in the shop, but wore spit 
shined boots and freshly starched utilities for formations and we always participated in PT. We were MotorT , 
but we were RECON MotorT !! In early January 1973, I was interviewed by Major Wakefield and 1st Sergeant Postalwaite.
 I apparently passed the interview, and was told to prepare for the PT test and dismissed. As I left the office 
 the 1st SGT noticed that I was limping a little and asked me about it. I explained that I had been on a force 
 march with my unit the previous week and had raised a few blisters on my feet. Understand here that 
 1st SGT Postalwaite was not someone who was well liked by the troops, NCOs,SNCOs or officers. From the stories
 I have heard about him he was mean and nasty just because he could be. He told me to remove my boots and socks, 
 my feet were blistered from the toes all the way back to the heels. He then asked again if I was willing to do 
 the PT test to which I said ‘yes’ and he said don’t worry about it. He then ordered me to go back to my unit, 
 pack my trash and get moved into the RECON barracks there at Camp Geiger. I was one of the very few who were 
 ever accepted without doing a PT test. Good thing too because I was NEVER a good runner. 22 minutes was my best 
 speed ever for 3 miles.</p>
