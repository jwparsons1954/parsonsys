<div class="backgndinfo" ><font size="7">Background information
</font>
</div>
<div class="text" id="backgrndinfo"><font size="7">The year was 1974, the war in Viet Nam had recently been called off due to lack of interest by the American people. I was 20 years old and a Corporal in the United States Marine Corps. And a member of 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company at Camp LeJuene North Carolina. 
	</font> 
</div>
<div><font size="7">The past 19 months I had trained to become a RECON Marine, but due to circumstances beyond my control it appeared I would soon be leaving RECON. You cannot imagine how devastated I was. 
	</font> </div>
<div><font size="7">When I joined the Corps I had a guaranteed MOS of aviation supply, a lucrative career field which some of my friends later re-enlisted to get into. I gave that up and requested to go to Camp LeJuene to become a GRUNT and then try out for RECON. Our company Gunny at Supply school came to me the day before graduation and offered me two sets of orders, If I accepted the orders for Yuma Arizona, I would graduate with my class (I was #3 in the class, so would have received a meritorious promotion to Lance corporal)  and in his words had an easy career in the air wing. I accepted the orders for Camp LeJuene and ended up at Kilo 3/8. 
	
</div>
<div>After spending time attached to regimental guard and being the company police sergeant for a time,  as I had a military driver’s License I was sent to help out in the MotorT section.

	

</div>
<div>	Much of my life before the Corps, was spent around automobile junkyards and shade tree mechanics. Our MotorT Chief at the time was SSGT Rollison, he was impressed with my work and asked if I would be willing to take the job of being the company dispatcher and shop chief. 
	I could now stay with the unit I had worked so hard and given up so much to get into. Obviously I accepted and stayed there until I left active duty in 1976.

	

</div>
<div>I believe it was sometime around the end of 1974, a new lance corporal arrived. His MOS was 3521 vehicle mechanic and surprisingly he was extremely squared away. He made  Sergeant well before I got out in 1976. At that time in the Corps MotorT types usually looked like hell. They wore fluff dried utilities and rarely put polish on their boots, and this was the SNCO’s and NCO’s, the non-rateds looked even worse.
It was rare for MotorT types to ever participate in Physical Training or worry about their appearance. The motor T section of 2nd Force Recon was different from the rest, just as you would expect us to be. We changed into coveralls and old boots to work in the shop, but wore spit shined boots and freshly starched utilities for formations and we always participated in PT. We were MotorT , but we were RECON MotorT !!
In early January 1973, I was interviewed by Major Wakefield and 1st Sergeant Postalwaite. I apparently passed the interview, and was told to prepare for the PT test and dismissed. As I left the office the 1st SGT noticed that I was limping a little and asked me about it. I explained that I had been on a force march with my unit the previous week and had raised a few blisters on my feet. Understand here that 1st SGT Postalwaite was not someone who was well liked by the troops, NCOs,SNCOs or officers. From the stories I have heard about him he was mean and nasty just because he could be. He told me to remove my boots and socks, my feet were blistered from the toes all the way back to the heels. He then asked again if I was willing to do the PT test to which I said ‘yes’ and he said don’t worry about it. He then ordered me to go back to my unit, pack my trash and get moved into the RECON barracks there at Camp Geiger.
	
</div>
<div>I was one of the very few who were ever accepted without doing a PT test. Good thing too because I was NEVER a good runner. 22 minutes was my best speed ever for 3 miles. I assume that 1st  SGT PostalWaite made arrangements with my old unit for this because I didn't actually receive my orders to 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company until the end of January.</div>
