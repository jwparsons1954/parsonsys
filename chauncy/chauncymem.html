<p>I would like to acknowledge the support of my family throughout the years. I want to dedicate this to all of you. We have had a lot of good times and memories to enjoy. I hope all of you enjoy this as much as I do.</p>

<p>In my younger years, I can remember that Paul told me, when he and Rita were first married, that times were pretty tough. The first year they almost starved. About all they had to eat were potatoes, a few veggies and meat once in a while. He told Rita, if they got through that winter, he would make sure they never went hungry again.
<p>Mom and I went down to Paul & Rita's one time to stay with them and Ed and Jerry for a week. Jerry and I used to steal pop from the gas station, sneak out back and drink it. One day we started up Paul's old 36 Chevy, drove it forwards and backwards again and again and somehow backed into the gas stations' grease pit. We worked and worked to block it up to get it out before we got caught. We parked it and Paul never knew about it. (We don't think he did, anyways!)
<p>One winter we lived north and west of Richard's garden and while I was playing around with my B-B gun, I shot the window out in Dad's and my bedroom. Dad wouldn't replace the window, he didn't cvare how cold it got, because he slept in his longjohns and socks. He would put on an old hood from Margaret's coat and tie it with binder twine. He kept warm even though there was snow on the bed in the morning.
<p>The Parsons family moved to Michigan in a model T truck. Mom and Dad and some of the girls rode in the truck. The older boys followed with the wagon and a team of horses. They had so many flat tires, and after Dad had used up all his patches, they had another flat on one of the front tires of the truck. They took the tire off and stuffed it full of corn stalks and dry grain and drove it on into Michigan to a station where they got it fixed. They settled for a short time in Mendon and lived in a big tent. Dad and the older boys got jobs with local farmers, saved a little money and moved north to Vicksburg. Pat and I were born in Michigan.
<p>When I was 18, I moved to Vicksburg and lived with Bill and Jeanette. I was working on the railroad, and I wanted to buy a used 1948 Chevy. Bill had always paid cash for everything, so he hadn;t established any credit. He mortgaged their furniture to get my car. When I went into the service , I gave the car to Bill and he finished paying off the 1/3, I still owed on it</p>
<p>When Bev and I were first married, we rented an upstairs apartment from Paul and Rita for $35.00 a month. That included electric! Cheap, Huh? We only had a space heater, so we bought our fuel oil and carried it upstairs, five gallons at a time. We bought bottle gas for our apartment-sized stove. The oven worked but it had no heat control. You really had to keep an eye on what you were cooking. We also had a green 1950 Plymouth.</P>
<p>When we lived on Orleans St. in Otsego, Roger and I would go to Kivelle's store for Addie. Sometimes while we were there we would add a box of raisins and a small bag of shredded coconut to the order. We would go down to the creek and eat raisins and spit juice into the creek. Then we would eat tyhe coconut on the way home.</p>
<p>I used t catch John Mason in the bar, sit down and he would sneak me a drink of beer and I would get a quarter from him. With a quarter, I could go to the movie for 14 cents, pay a nickel for a bag of popcorn, then stay for the second show, get another nickel bag of popcorn and spend the last penny on a piece of bubble-gum on the way ouy.</p>
