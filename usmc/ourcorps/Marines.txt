<h1>Marines... A special group.</h1>
<p>During my career as an active duty Marine, I served with many Marines from many parts of the country. They were black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Muslim, and American Indian. There were males, and there were females. They were smart-assed, polite, rude, and unprofessional, at times. Some were religious, honest, bitching, complaining, lying, sneaky, back-stabbing bastards and bitches. Many were adulterous, church-going, alcoholic, horn dogs. Fights were commonplace, and occurred almost weekly. <p>Then, we went to war. There, I saw a team of foul-mouthed, self-righteous, insensitive sons of bitches. They killed with impunity, and complete disregard for their safety. They shared toothbrushes, forks, canteens, and half-eaten candy. They slept at times, sitting upright, and back-to-back. They wiped their asses with one hand, while holding their chow in the other one. They went for days and nights, without sleep, and functioned as if they had just awakened from a long slumber. I saw them cry without tears, and laugh with tears. I saw them gently pick up the bodies of dead children, place and cover them, with more precision and respect than when folding a flag. I saw them kneel together, arm-in-arm with heads bowed, at the loss of one of their own. I saw atheists pray, and Chaplains curse like Bangkok Sailors. </p><p>Then, we came home. I saw crisp Marines, standing tall in formation, deliver salutes like a sushi chef with a sharp knife. As our nations colors popped and snapped under a gentle California breeze, I watched, as they marched out in front of their peers and stood motionless, while medals were pinned on their chest. I loved those bastards, with more respect and dignity, than my own family. Now that I am retired and living in the civilian community, I do not see Marines enough.</p>
